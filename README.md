This Python project automates YouTube video summarization using NLP. It searches videos via youtube-search-python, fetches transcripts with youtube-transcript-api, and summarizes content using Hugging Face’s BART model. Users input a topic, select a video, and receive a concise summary—ideal for quick content digestion. Built with PyTorch, Transformers, and HTTPX, it handles long transcripts by chunking and supports GPU acceleration for faster inference.
